# PYDOJO4
![](https://alessandronorfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/logo.png?w=150&h=143)

Fork of pydojo, made for compatibility with Python3.x.
A playful way to learn coding with Python, based on Pygame.

## First steps
Now that you have installed the Python interpreter and the necessary libraries, you can start playing with Pydojo.
To do it, simply create a .py new empty file (example: [myfirstgame.py](https://github.com/sprintingkiwi/PYDOJO/wiki/myfirstgame.py)) and open it with your IDE.
