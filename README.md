# PYDOJO
![alt text](https://alessandronorfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/logo.png?w=150&h=143)

A playful way to learn coding with Python, based on Pygame.

# GETTING STARTED
## Setup
- Install Python 2 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Open a terminal emulator (or command prompt)
- Execute the following commands (preceeded by "sudo" if on LINUX or MAC)
  - Install Pygame: "pip install pygame"
  - Install Pydojo: "pip install pydojo"
- Find a suitable IDE. I suggest
  - IDLE, the default Python IDE that comes with the Python interpreter installer (in LINUX you must "apt install idle)
  - Ninja IDE (http://ninja-ide.org/)
  - Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
  - WING IDE (https://wingware.com/)
  - Geany (https://www.geany.org/)
  
## First steps
Now that you have installed the Python interpreter and the necessary libraries, you can start playing with Pydojo.
To do it, simply create a .py new empty file (example: myfirstgame.py) and open it with your IDE.
